                            <p class="text-justify">Electrical engineering, one of the core courses of engineering discipline deals with the study of design, development, and maintenance of electrical systems and their components, ensuring quality, safety, reliability, and sustainability. The course focuses on the manufacturing of electrical equipment used in a number of sectors including construction and building and the production and distribution of power. Students pursuing electrical engineering study about semiconductors and microprocessors. The undergraduate course will award a B.Tech / B.E. degree and the postgraduate course, an M.Tech.</p>
               <h4 class="subhead">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</h4>
               <p class="text-justify"><b>For UG:</b> The candidate should have passed 10+2 examination from CBSE or any other equivalent examination board with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as core subjects. The candidates should also fulfil minimum qualifying marks in aggregate of the subjects.</p>
               <?php include_once('all-page-content-form.php'); ?>
               <p class="text-justify">For PG: The candidate should have a B.Tech degree with a minimum passing percentage in an aggregate of the subjects studied at the degree level.</p>
