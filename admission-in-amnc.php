            <p class="text-justify">The internship is at any command hospital and the cadets have various allowances during the course too. Army/Navy/Airforce is the option available unless you are choosing to pay out. Average salary depends upon the pay scale of Lieutenant rank(in Army..) and subsequently increases with the promotion. The alumni network is the BEST because you are somehow connected even to those who had passed out 20-25 years ago through your batch and AFG Number.</p>
            <h4 class="subhead">INFRASTRUCTURE & TRANSPORTATION</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">There are 2 hostels: (i) Boys' hostel complex (ii) Girls' hostel There's no fee for the hostel. It's a 100% residential college, so there's no point of PG. Food is of high standards and costs around Rs1500 per month The classrooms and overall infrastructure of this college is one of the best in this country</p>
