                            <h3 class="ramiya mt-3">Culture of Kyrgyzstan</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify mt-3">The Kyrgyz are descended from ancient Turkic tribes, and have been nomadic cattle breeders for centuries and a large part of the population remains semi-nomadic, with sheep often outnumbering the population! As in Kazakhstan, the culture of the horse is omnipresent. Competitions like Ulak Tartysh, a team game resembling a cross between polo and rugby and Jumby Atmai, the object of which is to break the thread holding a large bar of metal by shooting at it at a gallop reflect the importance of riding skills and games on horseback.</p>
