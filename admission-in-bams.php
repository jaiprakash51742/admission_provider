This degree programme is conferred to those students who studied modern medicines and traditional Ayurveda.
								<br> Ayurveda is one of the ancient medical systems of the world. It traces its roots to the Vedic period. It is not only providing the cure but also preventing the recurrence of diseases. According to the Ayurvedic, there are only three kinds of dysfunctions or disorders in the human body Kapha, Pitta and Vata.
								<br> These dysfunctions are commonly called the Dosha in Ayurvedic terminology. Kapha meant Phlegm (water and earth), Pitta meant Bile (fire & water) and Vata meant Wind (air and space). Ayurvedic says that a person got ill when he gets out of the harmony of said three doshas.
								<br> The Ayurvedic system of medical care is based on the concept where the natural healing capacity of the body is being enhanced by Ayurvedic therapy. Ayurvedic treatment includes reducing symptoms, eliminating impurities, reducing worry, increasing resistance of disease and increasing harmony of patient’s lives.
								<br> The Ayurvedic system is a trustful medical system in order to cure, prevent and rejuvenate. Yes, it takes more time to make the patient fit as before, but once the patient has been treated through this medical system, he will find him better than before he was.
								<br> “BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) is an undergraduate degree programme in the old and ancient Ayurvedic medical system containing the prevention and cure to the body by increasing the harmony of kapha, pitta and vata”.</p>
