            <h2><span id="interest-rates-of-mnssby-bihar-student-credit-card">Interest Rates of MNSSBY Bihar Student Credit Card</span></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Interest Rates for the Bihar Student Credit Card Yojana</strong> vary with the banks. Earlier, the Interest Rate of Canara Bank was 12% and Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank was 12.5% per year. But according to the latest information, the Bihar Government is providing loan at 4% simple interest. However, 1% is for the women, PWD, and transgender, through “Bihar Student Education Finance Corporation”.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, no interest is applicable for the course duration of 4 years (B.Tech) plus an additional year. Therefore, you need to pay your loan after 5 years of admission to the course in installments. However, you can also extend the deadline, by informing the DRCC. All you have to do is write an application form twice a year (July and December).</p>
