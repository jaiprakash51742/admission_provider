Georgia is a unitary, semi-presidential republic, with the government elected through a representative democracy. Also, Georgia country medical education is famous across the world. <b>Studying MBBS in Georgia</b> is something worth considering in case of students who wish to <b>study MBBS in Europe.</b><br> 
           There are many <b>WHO recognized medical colleges in Georgia</b>. Students who wish to study <b>MBBS in European countries</b> are choosing Georgia as their study destination due to various reasons. <b>MBBS in Georgia benefits</b> is huge in comparison to study <b>MBBS in England</b> or MBBS in Romania or any other European country for that matter.

            <h4 class="subhead">Information Regarding Duration of the MD / MBBS in Georgia</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The <b>MD / MBBS in Europe</b> is always 6 years program including internship. Georgia follows EU pattern of education and minimum 360 credits are required which is possible in 6 years. Few of the universities in Georgia are wrongly promoting with 5-year program format which is just to show that the budget is lesser. The admission letters issued by the Universities are always with 6 years! Accordingly, the cost applicable would be for 6 years though initial promotions are with 5 years program.</p>

It works to around Rs. 27,000 per month and almost Rs. 3 Lacs per annum! Generally, the universities and their agents promote only the fees structure without much emphasis on the apartment and living cost. However, many Indian agents hide or misinform the living cost in Georgia. In reality, the cost per year to <b>study MD / MBBS in Georgia</b> in ‘B’ graded universities works to almost Rs. 6 Lacs per annum including tuition fees and living cost. The Indian students can study in A+ graded universities such as Pirogov Russia NRM University located in the center of Moscow with this kind of budget!</p>
