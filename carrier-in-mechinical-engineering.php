                            <p class="text-justify">Mechanical engineering is a professional programme which helps students to understand the working mechanisms of heavy tools and machineries.  The branch applies principles of engineering, physics and material science for the design, analysis, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. The course covers technical areas like distribution of electricity through generators, transformers, transmission lines, lighting and wiring in buildings. A course in mechanical engineering makes a student gain knowledge and experience in the designing of electric motors, automobiles, aircrafts and other heavy vehicles. Mechanical engineering demands knowledge about software used in technical work like computer-aided design and mathematical modelling.</p>
