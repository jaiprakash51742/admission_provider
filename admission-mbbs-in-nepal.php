                            <h3 class="ramiya mt-3">Culture of Nepal</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify mt-3">Folklore is an integral part of Nepali society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life, tales of love, affection and battles as well as demons and ghosts and thus reflect local lifestyles, culture, and beliefs. Many Nepali folktales are enacted through the medium of dance and music. Most houses in the rural lowlands of Nepal are made up of a tight bamboo framework and walls of a mud and cow-dung mix. These dwellings remain cool in summer and retain warmth in winter. Houses in the hills are usually made of unbaked bricks with thatch or tile roofing. At high elevations construction changes to stone masonry and slate may be used on roofs. Nepal's flag is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape. The constitution of Nepal contains instructions for a geometric construction of the flag. According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal. Red also stands for aggression. The flag's blue border signifies peace. The curved moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepali, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors

                <h4 class="subhead mt-2">WHY STUDY MBBS IN Nepal</h4>
                
               <p class="text-justify">MBBS in Nepal is the best opportunity for the Indian students. Nepal is nearby to India and has amicable relations with the nation. Since long time students are studying medicine in Nepal, mostly majority of students is more from the Northern part of the country. The best thing about Nepal medical colleges is that most of the faculty is from India. There are numerous professors who belong to India. If you are looking for direct admission for MBBS in Nepal without donation in best medical colleges within your set budget under Management/Indian/foreign/quota in medical colleges, certainly you are at the right place. MBBS from Nepal is valid in India only after qualifying the MCI screening test once you complete the medical course.<br>
                Nepal is famous among Indian students majorly because the quality of education, competitive fee structure and less documentation are among the fewer reasons why for Indian students selecting this country for higher education. Contradictory to other countries, you do not require any visa to study in Nepal. Furthermore, the culture, food habits and lifestyle is matched to a great deal with that of India. All the medical colleges/universities are approved by the Medical Council of India. Even the syllabus curriculum is similar to the Indian counterparts. There is no such language barrier. Being English and Hindi as a communicative language spoken in Nepal, students will find easy to communicate with each other even with their patients at the time of their internship.
